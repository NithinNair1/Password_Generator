# Password Generator
  - Creates 10 letter passwords
  - Also it copies your generated password to clipboard, so you are ready to directly use it. This is done using PyperClip.
  - It uses os module to center the text.
  - Also this is the first time I am importing another .py file, i.e. letters.py.
